Data Set Problems 🤔
👉 This dataset contains information about drug classification based on patient general information and its diagnosis. Machine learning model is needed in order to predict the outcome of the drugs type that might be suitable for the patient.
Objectives of Notebook 📌
👉 This notebook aims to:

Dataset exploration using various types of data visualization.
Build various ML models that can predict drug type.
👨‍💻 The machine learning models used in this project are:

Linear Logistic Regression
Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K Neighbours
Naive Bayes (Categorical & Gaussian)
Decision Tree
Random Forest
